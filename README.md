## 📊 Project Overview

This repository contains a sentiment analysis system designed for ABC Restaurant to automatically classify customer reviews from their Facebook page as positive or negative. The system enables the restaurant to quickly identify unhappy customers and take proactive action to address concerns, improving customer retention and satisfaction.

## 🎯 Business Problem

ABC Restaurant needed an efficient way to:

- Automatically detect negative customer experiences
- Identify trends in customer complaints
- Establish an in-house customer support team
- Increase customer revisit rates

## 💡 Solution

Our sentiment analysis system provides:

- **Real-time classification** of customer reviews (positive/negative)
- **Actionable insights** into areas needing improvement
- **Zero to minimal operational costs** to implement

## 🧠 Theoretical Concepts

### Naive Bayes Classification

This project implements a **Naive Bayes classifier**, a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem:

$$P(y|x) = \frac{P(x|y) \times P(y)}{P(x)}$$

Where:
- $P(y|x)$ is the posterior probability of class $y$ given predictor $x$
- $P(x|y)$ is the likelihood of predictor given class
- $P(y)$ is the prior probability of class
- $P(x)$ is the prior probability of predictor

**Why Naive Bayes for Sentiment Analysis?**

1. **Efficiency**: Computationally efficient and fast, making it ideal for real-time analysis
2. **Performance with small datasets**: Works well even with limited training data
3. **Handling high-dimensional data**: Effective for text classification with large feature sets
4. **Probabilistic output**: Provides probability scores rather than just classifications

The "naive" assumption is that features are conditionally independent given the class label, which simplifies computation while still providing good results for text classification.

### Text Preprocessing Techniques

Our pipeline incorporates several NLP preprocessing steps:

1. **Tokenization**: Breaking text into individual words or tokens
2. **Stopword Removal**: Eliminating common words that add little meaning (e.g., "the", "and")
3. **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base form
4. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converting text to numerical features by considering:
   - Term Frequency (TF): How frequently a word appears in a document
   - Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): How rare a word is across all documents

$$\text{TF-IDF}(t, d, D) = \text{TF}(t, d) \times \text{IDF}(t, D)$$

This weighting scheme helps emphasize words that are distinctive to specific sentiment categories.
